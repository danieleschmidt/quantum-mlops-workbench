# ADR-001: Quantum Backend Abstraction Layer

## Status

Accepted

## Context

Quantum machine learning applications need to run on multiple quantum backends (simulators, AWS Braket, IBM Quantum, IonQ) with different APIs, capabilities, and constraints. Without a unified abstraction layer, developers must handle:

- Different API interfaces for each backend
- Varying circuit compilation requirements
- Backend-specific error handling
- Queue management and cost optimization
- Hardware-specific noise models

## Decision

Implement a unified quantum backend abstraction layer with the following components:

1. **QuantumDevice Enum**: Standardized backend identifiers
2. **BackendRouter**: Intelligent backend selection based on requirements
3. **QuantumExecutor Interface**: Common execution API across all backends
4. **CircuitCompiler**: Backend-specific circuit optimization
5. **ResultProcessor**: Unified result format and error handling

The abstraction provides:
```python
# Unified API regardless of backend
pipeline = QuantumMLPipeline(
    circuit=quantum_circuit,
    device=QuantumDevice.AUTO  # or specific backend
)
```

## Consequences

### Positive Consequences

- **Developer Experience**: Single API for all quantum backends
- **Portability**: Easy switching between backends for testing/deployment
- **Optimization**: Automatic backend selection based on circuit requirements
- **Cost Management**: Built-in cost estimation and optimization
- **Testing**: Simplified testing across multiple backends

### Negative Consequences

- **Performance Overhead**: Additional abstraction layer adds latency
- **Feature Limitations**: Lowest common denominator of backend features
- **Maintenance Burden**: Must keep up with API changes across all backends

### Neutral Consequences

- **Learning Curve**: Developers need to understand the abstraction layer
- **Debugging Complexity**: Additional layer between user code and quantum hardware

## Alternatives Considered

1. **Direct Backend APIs**: Rejected due to code duplication and complexity
2. **Plugin Architecture**: Too complex for initial implementation
3. **Single Backend Focus**: Rejected due to vendor lock-in risks
